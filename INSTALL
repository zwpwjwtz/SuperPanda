How To Build And Install
========================

Build
-----

There are 2 ways to build from source:

* Using QtCreator:

  1. Download and install the latest version of QtCreator;
    
  2. Open "SuperPanda.pro" with QtCreator;
    
  3. Compile the project.

* Using qmake:

  1. Download and install qmake. There might be other dependencies needed for qmake. For example, under Ubuntu you can:

            sudo apt-get install g++
            sudo apt-get install qt5-default

  2. Switch to the source directory and run qmake:
    
            cd SuperPanda/
            qmake
    
  3. Actually build the project:
    
            make
        

Install
-------

The built executable "SuperPanda" can be launched directly (either from terminal or file manager), without further configuration of environmental variables.
